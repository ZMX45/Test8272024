# Final_Project
Project Desription:
Final_Project is a java driven application used to manage the users movie backlog.
This application can create a backlog, view said backlog, and remove watched movies from the backlog and store them.

What techniques are used in this program:
An array is used to track watched movies and an array list is used to track the user's movie backlog.
Try catch blocks are used to ensure users can only enter the correct data types for the prompted questions.

Program options:
The program is run by compiling each file with "*.java" and running the "Runner" class with "Java Runner".
Option 1 adds movies to the user's watchlist.
Option 2 removes a movie from the watchlist and adds it to a list of movies watched.
Option 3 shows the user their current watch list and list of movies they have watched.
Option 4 exits the program.

Known Errors:
The movies watched list sometimes does not show
some error messages are awkwardly worded.
